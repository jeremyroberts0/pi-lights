# Pi Lights

Pi Lights is an app for controlling a strip of individually addressable LEDs accepting the ws281x protocol.

Features include:

- REST API for controller patterns and brightness (see API docs below)
- **Terminal debugger** for testing patterns without hardware (see Terminal Debugger section)
- MDNS server that enables routing to your pi on your local network via the hostname of the pi itself (the hostname of your pi is configured in the OS level)
- Self-updating by watching the master branch at https://github.com/jeremyroberts0/pi-lights
- Web interface wrapping the REST API for easy control on local network (note Chrome on Android does not support MDNS, so you have to navigiate via IP Address of the pi)

## Terminal Debugger

The terminal debugger allows you to test LED patterns in your terminal without needing actual LED hardware. Perfect for development and debugging!

### Quick Start

Run any of these commands to start in terminal debug mode:

```bash
# Simple debug mode
npm run debug

# Development mode with debug
npm run debug:dev

# Using command line flags
node src/index.js --terminal
node src/index.js --debug
node src/index.js -t

# Using environment variable
CONSOLE_VISUALIZER=true node src/index.js
```

### Visual Features

The terminal debugger displays:
- **Colored LED blocks** (â–ˆ) showing actual RGB colors
- **Position indicators** every 5th and 10th LED for reference  
- **LED count** and helpful instructions
- **Real-time updates** as patterns change

### Configuration Options

**Set LED Strip Size:**
```bash
# Via command line argument
node src/index.js --terminal --leds=50

# Via environment variable  
TERMINAL_LED_COUNT=100 npm run debug

# Default: Uses terminal width
```

**Available Environment Variables:**
- `CONSOLE_VISUALIZER=true` - Enable terminal mode
- `TERMINAL_LED_COUNT=N` - Set number of LEDs to simulate
- `NO_UPDATE=true` - Disable auto-updater (recommended for development)
- `PORT=8080` - Set custom port (default: 80)

### Usage Example

1. Start the debugger:
   ```bash
   npm run debug
   ```

2. In another terminal, test patterns:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/pattern/rainbow
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/brightness/75
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/pattern/xmas
   ```

3. Watch the patterns animate in your terminal!

The web interface is also available at `http://localhost:8080/index.html` for visual control.

## Wishlist

- Homeassistant integration

## Setup

### Hardware

Wire lights to Pi as per https://learn.adafruit.com/neopixels-on-raspberry-pi/raspberry-pi-wiring

- Data line in GPIO18
- Ground to Ground
- Power to 5v pin

Unless you're using a 5v LED strip, you'll need to inject power seperately.  Multiple strips require power injection at the beginning fo each strip

### Software

This procedure installs the app and runs it as a systemd service, which takes care of gathering logs and starting the app when the pi reboots.

1. Install NodeJS on the pi
2. Clone this repo to `/home/pi/pi-lights`
3. `cd /home/pi/pi-lights`
4. Install nodejs dependencies `npm i --no-save`
6. Copy `pilights.service` to `/lib/systemd/system/pilights.service`
7. `sudo systemctl enable pilights.service`

The app is now running and available on port 80.  View logs with: `journalctl -u pilights.service`.

The app includes an auto update feature.  It polls github occasionally to check for changes and update itself.  You'll need to create an ssh key on your pi and add it to your Github account or to the pilights repo in order to for this to work.
